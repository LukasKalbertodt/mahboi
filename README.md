Mahboi â€“ yet another Game Boy emulator
======================================

Hobby project. WIP.


## Requirements

To compile this project, you need a nightly compiler. This is because we are already using the *Rust 2018* edition which is not quite stable yet. However, most features contained in *Rust 2018* are already fairly stable and are just waiting for stabilization. So it's not like we're using features that will break tomorrow. To use (and install) a nightly compiler for this project, run:

```
$ rustup override set nightly
```

You can also use `nightly-2018-08-06` instead, if you want to have the exact version I'm using right now. But as I said: future versions shouldn't break anything.

To compile the WASM part of this project, additional software is required. See the README in the `web/` folder for more information.

## Documentation and Information

#### Random facts:
- The classic *Game Boy* is also called *DMG* or *DMG-01* (dot matrix game, development name).
- The *Game Boy Color* is also called *CGB*.
