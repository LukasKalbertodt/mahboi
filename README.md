Mahboi â€“ yet another Game Boy emulator
======================================

This is merely a hobby project of ours.
Our goal is just to play a couple games we enjoyed when we were young :)
Feel free to check out the code or try it for yourself.
But you most certainly want to use a different emulator if you plan on actually playing games.
We have a somewhat nice debugger though!

## Building and Running

You need a somewhat recent version of Rust and Cargo to compile this project.
To run the emulator, your system needs to support Vulkan (as we depend on `pixels`, which uses `wgpu`, which uses Vulkan).

On Linux, you additionally need some native libraries:

- ALSA sound (`libasound2-dev` on Ubuntu)
- Ncurses (`libncurses-dev` and `libncursesw6` on Ubuntu)
- You maybe need these ones as well (but I'm not sure, sorry :D): `libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-cursor0 libwayland-dev`


## Documentation and Information

There is some information and a couple of links [in the wiki](https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/mahboi/wiki).

A very rough roadmap with things that still need to be fixed can be seen here: https://github.com/LukasKalbertodt/mahboi/issues/39
